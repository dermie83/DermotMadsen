PART J: (3/3)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Art piece on display window

I have a very simple image based on the theme of a grid (16x9). Depending on 
3 equality conditions (equals, greater than and less than), the X and Y axis
show a random row and column of a particular shape and colour.
It is interactive - by pressing and or holding down the left mouse button
the sequence will stop on a random shape, colour, grid and display the frame count 
at that instance. You can save the image by pressing the right mouse button.
To get the full experience of this art piece I would highly recommend accompanying 
it with electronic music!
I give the piece a total of 80%

PART K: (4/5) 1 mark deducted for its visual simplicity
